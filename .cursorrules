# Package Manager
- Use Bun for all package management operations (install, run, etc.)
- Never use npm, yarn, or pnpm commands

# Framework & Runtime
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- React 19 with Server Components (RSC) by default
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Use async/await for server components and data fetching

# Date & Time
- Always check the current date when unsure instead of guessing
- Use system date/time information when available
- Never assume or hardcode dates without verification

# Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Use path aliases (`@/`) for imports instead of relative paths
- Prefer functional components with async server components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling - no inline styles or CSS modules
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns and conventions

# File Structure
- Skills are stored in `skills/` directory as markdown files named `SKILL.md`
- Skills are organized by category (templates, best-practices, process)
- Components go in `components/` directory
- UI components from shadcn/ui go in `components/ui/`
- Utility functions go in `lib/` directory

# Component Patterns
- Use shadcn/ui components from `@/components/ui/`
- Server components by default, use 'use client' directive only when needed
- Prefer composition over configuration
- Use Card, Button, and other shadcn components consistently

# Best Practices
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript types for all functions and components
- Follow Next.js conventions for file naming and routing
- Ensure all async operations are properly handled
- Use semantic HTML and accessible components
- Maintain consistent code formatting

# Skills System
- Skills are markdown files that must be named `SKILL.md` (case-insensitive)
- Skills are automatically discovered from the `skills/` directory structure
- Category is determined by the parent directory name
- Title is extracted from the first `# ` heading in the markdown file
