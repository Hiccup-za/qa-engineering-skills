# Skills Catalog

This catalog groups QA process and best-practice skills. Each skill lives in its
own folder with a `SKILL.md` and optional `assets/`, `references/`, or `scripts/`.

## Categories
- `process/`: Planning, risk analysis, and execution workflows.
- `best-practices/`: Technique-oriented guidance and review checklists.
- `templates/`: Reusable scaffolding for new skills and assets.
